//! Oneshot spsc channel. The sender's send method is non-blocking, lock- and wait-free[1].
//! The receiver supports both lock- and wait-free `try_recv` as well as indefinite and time
//! limited thread blocking receive operations. The receiver also implements `Future` and
//! supports asynchronously awaiting the message.
//!
//! This is a oneshot channel implementation. Meaning each channel instance can only transport
//! a single message. This has a few nice outcomes. One thing is that the implementation can
//! be very efficient, utilizing the knowledge that there will only be one message. But more
//! importantly, it allows the API to be expressed in such a way that certain edge cases
//! that you don't want to care about when only sending a single message on a channel does not
//! exist. For example. The sender can't be copied or cloned and the send method takes ownership
//! and consumes the sender. So you are guaranteed, at the type level, that there can only be
//! one message sent.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A very basic example to just show the API:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "sync"))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! # #[cfg(feature = "sync")]
//! # fn main() {
//! # use std::thread;
//! let (sender, receiver) = oneshot::channel();
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     sender.send("Hello from worker thread!");
//! });
//!
//! let message = receiver.recv().expect("Worker thread does not want to talk :(");
//! println!("A message from a different thread: {}", message);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! A slightly larger example showing communicating back work of *different types* during a
//! long computation. The final result here could have been communicated back via the thread's
//! `JoinHandle`. But those can't be waited on with a timeout. This is a quite artificial example,
//! that mostly shows the API.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "sync"))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! # #[cfg(feature = "sync")]
//! # fn main() {
//! # use core::time::Duration;
//! # use std::thread;
//! # fn expensive_initialization() -> Data { Data }
//! # struct Data;
//! # impl Data {
//! #     fn summary(&self) -> &'static str { "" }
//! #     fn expensive_computation(self) -> Vec<u8> { Vec::new() }
//! # }
//! let (sender1, receiver1) = oneshot::channel();
//! let (sender2, receiver2) = oneshot::channel();
//!
//! let thread = thread::spawn(move || {
//!     let data_processor = expensive_initialization();
//!     sender1.send(data_processor.summary()).expect("Main thread not waiting");
//!     sender2.send(data_processor.expensive_computation()).expect("Main thread not waiting");
//! });
//!
//! let summary = receiver1.recv().expect("Worker thread died");
//! println!("Initialized data. Will crunch these numbers: {}", summary);
//!
//! let result = loop {
//!     match receiver2.recv_timeout(Duration::from_secs(1)) {
//!         Ok(result) => break result,
//!         Err(oneshot::RecvTimeoutError::Timeout) => println!("Still working..."),
//!         Err(oneshot::RecvTimeoutError::Disconnected) => panic!("Worker thread died"),
//!     }
//! };
//! println!("Done computing. Results: {:?}", result);
//! thread.join().expect("Worker thread panicked");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Sync vs async
//!
//! The main motivation for writing this library was that there were no (known to me) channel
//! implementations allowing you to seamlessly send messages between a normal thread and an async
//! task, or the other way around. If message passing is the way you are communicating, of course
//! that should work smoothly between the sync and async parts of the program!
//!
//! This library achieves that by having an almost[1] wait-free send operation that can safely
//! be used in both sync threads and async tasks. The receiver has both thread blocking
//! receive methods for synchronous usage, and implements `Future` for asynchronous usage.
//!
//! The receiving endpoint of this channel implements Rust's `Future` trait and can be waited on
//! in an asynchronous task. This implementation is completely executor/runtime agnostic. It should
//! be possible to use this library with any executor.
//!
//! # Footnotes
//!
//! [1]: See documentation on [Sender::send] for situations where it might not be fully wait-free.

// # Implementation description
//
// When a channel is created via the channel function, it allocates space on the heap to fit:
// * A one byte atomic integer that represents the current channel state,
// * Uninitialized memory to fit the message,
// * Uninitialized memory to fit the waker that can wake the receiving task or thread up.
//
// The size of the waker depends on which features are activated, it ranges from 0 to 24 bytes[1].
// So with all features enabled (the default) each channel allocates 25 bytes plus the size of the
// message, plus any padding needed to get correct memory alignment.
//
// The Sender and Receiver only holds a raw pointer to this heap channel object. The last endpoint
// to be consumed or dropped is responsible for freeing the heap memory. The first endpoint to
// go away signal via the state that it is gone. And the second one see this and frees the memory.
//
// Sending on the sender copies the message to the (so far uninitialized) memory region on the
// heap and swaps the state from whatever it was to MESSAGE.
// if the state before the swap was DISCONNECTED the SendError is returned and nothing else is done.
// The SendError now owns the heap channel memory and is responsible for dropping the message
// and freeing the memory.
// If the state was RECEIVING the sender reads the waker object from the channel heap memory and
// call the unpark method, which will wake up the receiver.
//
// Receiving on the channel first checks the state. If it is MESSAGE the message object is read
// from the heap back into the stack, the heap memory is freed and the message returned. If the
// state is DISCONNECTED the heap memory is freed and an error is returned. And if the state is
// EMPTY and the receive operation is a blocking one it creates a waker object and writes it to
// the channel on the heap and does an atomic compare_and_swap on the state from EMPTY to RECEIVING.
// If the swap went fine, it either parks the thread or returns Poll::Pending, depending on if
// the receive is a blocking or an async one. It now just waits for the sender to wake it up.
//
//
// ## Footnotes
//
// [1]: Mind that the waker only takes zero bytes when all features are disabled, making it
//      impossible to *wait* for the message. `try_recv` the only available method in this scenario.
